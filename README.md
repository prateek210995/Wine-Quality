# Wine-Quality

Analysis of Wine Quality dataset using R, Python and Tableau obtained from Paulo Cortez,
UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is found that alcohol, citric acid, residual sugar, total sulfur dioxide,
and chlorides content is responsible for wine quality to be better. And acidity of wine can determine the
price of wine. Built a Linear Regression model for determining density of wine using R. Few SQL queries
executed on dataset using PostgreSQL for analysis.
